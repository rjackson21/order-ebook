# README

The purpose of this app was to be able to sell an ebook without needing to pay squarespace anymore! This app has been on a long list of project ideas, and at this point in my programming journey it is fully possible. My intent is for this app to be full-stack with a rails back-end and react front-end. Both the webpacker gem and the rails-react gem are being used. This is currently being built to be a singular landing page that presents a checkout form on the click of a order button, although that might expand as the app develops. This app is currently running on Ruby 2.7 and Rails 7.
